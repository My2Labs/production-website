Each headline has an image (if available through the API), a summary of the headline, and a link to an external website to read more from the source.  The headlines update regularly throughout each day.  The main page also provides ficticious information relating to sending Science headlines, local resources for visitors, and an upcoming Science camp teaser headline.
